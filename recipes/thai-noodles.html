    <h2>Chicken, vegetables, and noodles prepared in a light tasting but full-flavored Asian-inspired sauce. </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons water </li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth </li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®), or more to taste </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander </li>
